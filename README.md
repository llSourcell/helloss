# Neuro-Analyst OS

**Automated EEG Preprocessing and Visualization**

This Python library drastically reduces the time and expertise required to turn raw EEG data into clean, analyzable data and publication-quality visualizations.

## Core Philosophy

- **Opinionated Automation:** Smart, scientifically-defensible choices are made for the user.
- **Transparency & Trust:** The `clean()` function generates a detailed, interactive validation report.
- **Beautiful by Default:** All plotting functions produce publication-ready charts with minimal configuration.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install
```

## Usage

```python
import neuro_analyst as na

# Load your EEG data
raw = na.load("path/to/your/data.edf")

# Clean the data with a single command
cleaned_raw = na.clean(raw)
```

## "Before vs. After" Cleaning Report

Here's a glimpse of the interactive HTML report generated by `na.clean()`, showcasing the power spectral density before and after cleaning. Notice the significant reduction in 60Hz powerline noise!
